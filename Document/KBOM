1. Introduction
Overview of KBOM
The Kubernetes Bill of Materials (KBOM) is a comprehensive inventory of all components, dependencies, and their respective vulnerabilities within a Kubernetes environment. It helps in ensuring transparency and security by providing visibility into the various packages, libraries, and containers that make up the Kubernetes infrastructure.

KBOM is essential for tracking:

Dependencies: What components are being used in a given Kubernetes cluster.
Vulnerabilities: Identifying any existing security vulnerabilities in the components.
Software Components: Providing a comprehensive list of the software packages that make up the cluster's application stack.
The goal of generating a KBOM is to increase awareness about the software stack and its security posture, helping developers and operators prioritize vulnerabilities and ensure better risk management.

Objective of the Assignment
The objective is to generate a Kubernetes Bill of Materials using the following tools:

Trivy
Syft
OWASP Dependency-Track
Furthermore, the KBOM will be enriched with:

CPE (Common Platform Enumeration): Identifying components uniquely.
Vulnerabilities: Including vulnerability information such as CVEs.
Prioritization: Using CISA's KEV (Known Exploited Vulnerabilities) and EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System) to prioritize vulnerabilities based on their impact and exploitability.

2. Tools Overview

Trivy
Trivy is an open-source security scanner designed to detect vulnerabilities in container images. It supports scanning for vulnerabilities in both operating system packages and application dependencies within container images and Helm charts.
Key Features:
Vulnerability scanning for images and file systems.
Reports CVEs with severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low).
Supports scanning for misconfigurations.
Integrates with GitHub Actions and CI/CD pipelines for continuous monitoring.
Trivy’s output will help generate the KBOM by providing detailed information on any security vulnerabilities within the Kubernetes images.

Syft
Syft is a tool for generating Software Bill of Materials (SBOMs) for container images, filesystems, and repositories.
Key Features:
Generates SBOMs to identify the packages and dependencies that are included in container images.
Supports generating reports in various formats like JSON and CycloneDX.
Can identify licenses and dependencies that may have security or legal implications.
Syft will generate the list of components that are present in the Kubernetes images, and this list will form part of the KBOM.

OWASP Dependency-Track
OWASP Dependency-Track is a Software Composition Analysis (SCA) tool that helps in managing the security posture of a software project. It tracks the components in a project and analyzes vulnerabilities in them.
Key Features:
Tracks components across multiple projects.
Integrates with SBOMs from tools like Syft and Trivy.
Helps in managing vulnerabilities, their severity, and possible mitigations.
Prioritization of vulnerabilities based on risk, such as CISA’s KEV or EPSS.
Dependency-Track will integrate with the SBOMs generated by Syft and Trivy and will manage and track vulnerabilities to help prioritize remediation efforts.
