KBOM Schema Integration with a Real Application

We will create a small real-world web application with Dockerized microservices, integrate KBOM (Knowledge Bill of Materials) Schema, and automate the scanning and monitoring process using GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.

Why Do We Need KBOM for an Application?

1. Security & Vulnerability Management
KBOM helps track dependencies and their vulnerabilities.
It provides a CVE (Common Vulnerability Exposure) list of security issues in dependencies.

2. Compliance & Auditing
Helps in compliance tracking for regulations like ISO 27001, NIST, and SOC2.
Ensures no vulnerable dependencies are in production.

3. Dependency Visibility
Provides visibility into all third-party components used.
Helps developers track software versions and updates.

4. Industrial Use Cases
Used in banks, e-commerce, cloud security, and DevSecOps for monitoring open-source dependencies.
Helps companies reduce supply chain risks.

Application Flow & CI/CD KBOM Integration
ðŸ“Œ Application Overview
