KBOM Schema Integration with a Real Application

We will create a small real-world web application with Dockerized microservices, integrate KBOM (Knowledge Bill of Materials) Schema, and automate the scanning and monitoring process using GitHub Actions CI/CD pipeline.

Why Do We Need KBOM for an Application?

1. Security & Vulnerability Management
KBOM helps track dependencies and their vulnerabilities.
It provides a CVE (Common Vulnerability Exposure) list of security issues in dependencies.

2. Compliance & Auditing
Helps in compliance tracking for regulations like ISO 27001, NIST, and SOC2.
Ensures no vulnerable dependencies are in production.

3. Dependency Visibility
Provides visibility into all third-party components used.
Helps developers track software versions and updates.

4. Industrial Use Cases
Used in banks, e-commerce, cloud security, and DevSecOps for monitoring open-source dependencies.
Helps companies reduce supply chain risks.

Application Flow & CI/CD KBOM Integration
ðŸ“Œ Application Overview
A Node.js Backend API (Express.js) serving data.
A React.js Frontend consuming the API.
A Dockerized microservice structure.
CI/CD pipeline for KBOM scanning & automatic updates.

Final Flow: How Everything Works

Developer Pushes Code to GitHub ðŸš€
GitHub Actions Triggers KBOM Workflow
Installs dependencies.
Scans for vulnerabilities.
Updates KBOM JSON.
Commits KBOM file.
CI/CD Pipeline Runs
Builds Docker images.
Deploys backend & frontend.
Manual Scan (scan_dependencies.sh)
Can be run anytime to check vulnerabilities.

ðŸ“Œ Conclusion
KBOM keeps track of security risks by identifying vulnerabilities in dependencies.
This automates security monitoring using GitHub Actions + Trivy.
The CI/CD pipeline integrates KBOM security scanning before deployment.
