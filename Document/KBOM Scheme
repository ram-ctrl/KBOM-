1. Introduction to KBOM Schema
The KBOM Schema provides a structured way to capture metadata related to the components, their versions, dependencies, and vulnerabilities in a software application. Itâ€™s a key aspect of Security Bill of Materials (SBOM) that helps organizations understand the risks in their software stack by keeping track of vulnerable components and their relationships.

2. Key Fields in the KBOM Schema

Component Name: The name of the software component (e.g., openssl, nginx).
Version: The specific version of the component (e.g., 1.1.1, 2.3.0).
CPE (Common Platform Enumeration): A standardized way to reference software components,
used to identify the software in vulnerability databases (e.g., cpe:/a:openssl:openssl:1.1.1).
Dependency Relationships: Information about which components depend on other components. 
This could be direct or transitive dependencies.
Vulnerability Data: Captures the known vulnerabilities affecting a component, including:
CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) identifiers.
Severity (e.g., low, medium, high).
A description of the vulnerability.
The date of discovery.
